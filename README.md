# Recipe Recommendation Data Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline that ingests recipe data and grocery inventory data, stores them in a structured database, and generates meal recommendations based on available ingredients.

The goal is to showcase practical data engineering and analytics skills, including data ingestion, cleaning, modeling, and querying.
